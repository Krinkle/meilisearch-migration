# Contributing <!-- omit in TOC -->

First of all, thank you for contributing to MeiliSearch! The goal of this document is to provide everything you need to know in order to contribute to MeiliSearch and its different integrations.

- [Assumptions](#assumptions)
- [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
- [Git Guidelines](#git-guidelines)
- [Release Process (for internal team only)](#release-process-for-internal-team-only)

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)(PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the MeiliSearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [MeiliSearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/resources/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-migration/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-migration/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the meilisearch-migration repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Make the changes on your branch.
5. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-migration repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
   We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-migration/releases/).

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in TOC -->

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits <!-- omit in TOC -->

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:

- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests <!-- omit in TOC -->

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. If it's not, you have to rebase your branch. Check out this [quick tutorial](https://gist.github.com/curquiza/5f7ce615f85331f083cd467fc4e19398) to successfully apply the rebase from a forked repository.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes.

## Release Process (for internal team only)

MeiliSearch tools follow the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/).

### Automated Changelogs <!-- omit in toc -->

This project integrates a tool to create automated changelogs.<br>
_[Read more about this](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/release-drafter.md)._

### How to Publish the Release <!-- omit in toc -->

⚠️ Before doing anything, make sure you got through the guide about [Releasing an Integration](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/integration-release.md).

You can publish the current draft release via the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/meilisearch/XXX/releases): on this page, click on `Edit` (related to the draft release) > update the description (be sure you apply [these recommandations](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/integration-release.md#writting-the-release-description)) > when you are ready, click on `Publish release`.
